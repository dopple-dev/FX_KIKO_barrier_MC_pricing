• Implemented Chen et al. (2011) unbiased approach for simulating and discretizing the SABR process combining non-central chi-squared distribution direct inversion, QE method and small disturbance expansion for conditional moments derivation, to provide an accurate Monte Carlo simulation framework.

• Increased Barrier pricing accuracy using conditional CEV sampling and integrated variance process
